# 📝 To-Do List (Java Console Application)

A simple **console-based To-Do List application in Java** that helps you manage your daily tasks.  
You can **add, view, update, remove, mark as completed, and search tasks**.  
All tasks are stored in a file (`tasks.txt`), so they remain saved even after closing the program.

- ✔️ Remove tasks by task number
